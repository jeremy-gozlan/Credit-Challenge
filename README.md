# Credit-Challenge

As part of the MAP569 - Machine Learning II at Ecole Polytechnique, we had to compete in a Credit prediction Data Challenge. The goal of this challenge was to build a solution to predict whether we should accord a credit to an individual or not. It required NLP techniques, data analysis and the testing/comparaison of multiple ML algorithms. In order to find the best hyperparameters we used DeepHyper. 

For this project, I teamed up with Romain Egele.
